This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Project Overview

This project is a **front-end technical test** built using **Vue.js** and **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform) to provide a smooth, interactive user interface. The project aims to showcase dynamic content, including scroll-triggered animations and hover effects.

## Technologies Used
